# Library-Management-System-Database-


The Library Management System is a robust backend project built entirely using MySQL. It demonstrates the use of advanced SQL techniques, including views, triggers, stored procedures, and efficient database schema design. The project is designed to manage books, authors, members, loans, and returns, with features such as tracking overdue books, listing the most borrowed books, and generating comprehensive borrowing reports.

Features

Database Schema: Tables for books, authors, members, loans, and returns with well-defined relationships.

Advanced Queries: Includes finding overdue books, listing most borrowed books, and generating trend reports.

Triggers: Automates book status updates when loans are created or returned.
